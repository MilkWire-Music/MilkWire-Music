## How publishing content on MilkWire works 

Content is published on MilkWire using the following process:


1. CAR file is generated. (Same process as https://car.ipfs.io/)
2. CAR file is uploaded to an ipfs node and replicated via pinning service (nft.storage) 
3. Artist publishes new album. This is an interaction with the smart contract. This adds the CID for the uploaded CAR file to the new entry in the artist's collection. 
4. Users are able to pull the latest music by polling the smart contract for the user's address on the smart contract.
